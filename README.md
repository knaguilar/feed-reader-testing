# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I come in.


## Getting Started
To run the application: download the github repo and then open index.html in the browser.
The jasmine tests should automatically run and will appear at the bottom of the page.
The file for the jasmine tests are located in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js
